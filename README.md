# Wafer Defect Detection Project

## <span style="color: #2E8B57;">Overview</span>

The **Wafer Defect Detection Project** aims to design and develop an automated system that detects faults on semiconductor wafers. The ability to identify defects during the manufacturing process is crucial to ensure that semiconductor wafers perform as expected. Early defect detection reduces the chance of faulty chips reaching the market, thereby saving costs associated with defective electronic devices.

In semiconductor manufacturing, where precision is key, automated defect detection mechanisms are essential for improving efficiency and maintaining high quality. This project leverages **machine learning** and **image processing** techniques to automatically detect and classify defects on semiconductor wafers with a high degree of accuracy.

## <span style="color: #4682B4;">Motivation</span>

The types of defects found in semiconductor wafers are diverse, ranging from:

- Unwanted particles
- Surface and subsurface defects
- Contamination
- Crystal and dopant irregularities
- Lithography errors
- Thin film defects

Traditional inspection methods, which rely on manual processes or outdated algorithms, lack the precision and speed required by today’s high-volume production lines. The Wafer Defect Detection Project aims to solve this problem by integrating **artificial intelligence** to enhance the detection process.
